    <div id="volcanic">
      <h4> Volcanic Mountains </h4>
      <p>Volcanic mountains form when molten rock from deep inside the Earth erupts through the crust and piles up on itself.
        The islands of Hawaii were formed by undersea volcanoes, and the islands seen above water today are the remaining volcano tops.
        Well-known volcanoes on land include Mount St. Helens in Washington State and Mount Fuji in Japan.
        Sometimes volcanic eruptions break down mountains instead of building them up, like the 1980 eruption that blew the top off Mount St. Helens.</p>

    <div id="convergent">
      <h4>Convergent Mountains </h4>
      <p>Convergent mountains are formed when pieces of Earth's crust - called plates - smash against each other in a process called plate tectonics, and buckle up like the hood of a car in a head-on collision.
        The Himalaya in Asia formed from one such massive wreck that started about 55 million years ago. Thirty of the world's highest mountains are in the Himalaya.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="fault-block">
      <h4> Fault-Block Mountains </h4>
      <p>Fault-block mountains are formed when stresses within and between the tectonic plates lead to cracking and faulting of the Earth's surface, which forces blocks of rock up and down.
        Examples of fault-block mountains include the Sierra Nevada in California and Nevada, the Tetons in Wyoming, and the Harz Mountains in Germany.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="dome">
      <h4> Dome Mountains </h4>
      <p>Dome mountains are formed when magma pushes the crust up but hardens before erupting onto the surface.
        Wind and rain pummel the domes, sculpting peaks and valleys.
        Examples of dome mountains include the Black Hills of South Dakota and the Adirondack Mountains of New York.</p>

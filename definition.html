    <h1>How are mountains defined?</h1><br>

    <div>
      <p>The mighty chunks rise all over the world, including the oceans.
        They usually have steep, sloping sides and sharp or rounded ridges, and a high point, called a peak or summit.
        Most geologists classify a mountain as a landform that rises at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) or more above its surrounding area.
        A mountain range is a series or chain of mountains that are close together.</p><br>
